# MEOM-GROUP tutos

Welcome to MEOM !

Here you can find useful informations about how we make scientific analysis.

 - First, we are using mostly Linux and Mac distributions, so a prerequisiste is to know the basics Unix Shell commands, if it is not your case, have a look at this [tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

 - Then, a nice way to back-up and access your work (scripts, notebooks, text files, etc ...) from anywhere is to create a [github account](https://github.com/) and to synchronize your work there. Learn how to do it [here](git-github.md)
 
 - If you are working with python, we recommend that you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage your librairies via environments. Learn how to do it [here](conda.md)
 
 - Also a nice way to have the code you write and the plots you produce at the same place, along with some texts, equations and/or pictures is to use [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Learn how to install and use it [here](jupyter.md)

 - Next, you may want to access some remote computers in order to have more ressources than on your personnal laptop or to access some datasets, you have several options :
    - the team server cal1 allows you to access MEOM data and is also a gateway to other machines. Learn how to access and use it [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/tree/master/cal1#readme)
    - the Grenoble meso computing center [GRICAD](https://gricad.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) for bigger computations. Learn how to compute there [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/tree/master/gricad#readme)
    - the national supercomputers located at [IDRIS](http://www.idris.fr/), [CINES](https://www.cines.fr/) or [TGCC](https://www-hpc.cea.fr/fr/complexe/tgcc-JoliotCurie.htm) for even bigger computations
  
 - A storage unit is available for all MEOM members and collaborators, you can store your data there, share them with some collaborators or to the outside world, access the same files on different computing machines (IGE-calcul1, GRICAD-dahu/bigfoot). Learn how to access it [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/summer.md)

A list of useful softwares and how to learn about them is available [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/software.md)

Also, you can learn on how to deploy jupyter notebooks on different machines : [cal1](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/cal1/jupyter-on-cal1.md), [occigen](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/occigen/jupyter-notebook-on-occigen.md), [jean zay](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/jean-zay/jupyter-notebook-on-jean-zay.md) and [gricad](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/gricad/jupyter-notebooks-on-gricad.md)
