# Data analysis software used in MEOM group and how to learn it.

authors : Julien Le Sommer, Aur√©lie Albert and Redouane Lguensat (MEOM group, IGE)

*This page provides a curated list of software used for data analysis in the MEOM group, online resources on how to use it and general advice on how to proceed with ocean data analysis. Please, keep in mind that (i) this list is not exhaustive and that (ii) it may evolve with time.*

## General advice

A nice mental picture for understanding most of our data analysis tasks is the **notion of data analysis pipeline**. Our data analyses generally combine several steps, all corresponding to individual pieces of software. Our data flows through the pipeline and gets transformed at each step by a particular piece of software. Ideally these pipelines shoud be as **automated** as possible so that our work is easily **reproducible**. 


A key principle for building data analysis pipelines is to try to **rely as much as possible on pre-existing software**. In practice, most of the steps in an analysis pipeline are very generic (as eg. reading/writing/plotting data) so that we can just use preexisting code. So a large fraction of our work just involves glueing together existing pieces of code. This is why modern software is now made as modular as possible. 

If you need to write new code, it should **focus in priority on what is specific** to your analysis. Some building-blocks of your data analysis pipeline are indeed more specific to your needs than others. For these key specific steps, you might have to write a dedicated module, but you should always first wonder if someone has already implemented something close to what you need. 

Knowing what is currently feasible with your sofware environment is therefore key for designing your own analyses. This requires your keeping **a routine curiosity for software**. In practice, this requires your spending time going through online videos and tutorials (because you learn better through examples). This also requires your being aware of minimal [good practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037) in scientific computing. 

In this page, you will find a **curated list of software**, tutorials and examples that we hope will improve your awareness of your technological environment. Do not hesitate to suggest new links and update to this page.

### Machine Learning with python :
Recently, machine learning (ML) methods are leading to impressive performances in signal/image/vision fields, in particular, neural networks made a strong come-back thanks to a technique called deep learning (DL) [(Nature paper)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539). Maybe you heard about AlphaGo the algorithm that beat the world champion in the game Go [(story)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol), or you heard about the Microsoft team that developed an algorithm able to surpass Human-Level performance on classification of ImageNet a popular image dataset [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852). These are just a glimpse of what DL is doing right now, for more information, you can take a look at these excellent articles [1](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513696/deep-learning/),[2](http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/). In our group we are starting to investigate the possibility of transferring the knowledge gained in the machine learning community to tackle ocean related inverse problems.

For newcomers into ML we strongly recommend Andrew Ng's ML [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (It's an old course so it still uses Matlab). Then the DL specialization suggested by Andrew Ng (again) is a great introduction to DL [(course)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (2017, so it's Python time!).

The following packages are mainly used by our team for ML:
  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, scikit-learn is the standard package used by industry and education for machine learning with Python. [Tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) (FYI: It's first released version was done by INRIA researchers)
  * [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org): Developed by Google, TF is currently the most used Python library for DL according to Github pull requests history and Google trends. 
  * [Keras](https://keras.io): Keras is a high-level neural networks API, that can run on top of TensorFlow. Meaning that it is more "user friendly" than Tensorflow (allows easier prototyping, basically classical layers are ready-to-use with minimum code). In our group, we rely on Keras for direct applications that require optimizing popular existing neural networks techniques. Some tutorials could be found [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/).
  * [*PyTorch*](http://pytorch.org) (developed by Facebook) which is gaining ground and can be considered as a strong competitor to TF. It is used by our group for rather complex applications where new neural network design choices are needed. It has the advantage of relying on dynamic graphs (Define-and-Run) which is a more nature way of programming, more details can be found [here](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/3801/what-is-a-dynamic-computational-graph) (Note that TF has recently added a new functionality to allow for the use of dynamical graphs).  
  * Other libraries for DL in Python exist such as [*Theano*](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) (historical library developed by MILA Montr√©al), [*Caffe*](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org), [*CNTK*](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/cognitive-toolkit/) (developed by Microsoft), [*MXNET*](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org) (Amazon), [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai), etc.

### Data visualization with python :
There are currently too many libraries for visualizing data with python (see this [python data vizualization tour](https://dansaber.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/)), this may seem exciting or overwhelming depending on the point of view... In practice, you should distinguish libraries that focus on *interactive data visualization* (great for investigating your datasets in Jupyter notebooks) and libraries that focus on *static data visualization* (needed for writing papers and reports). Several of the more recent visualization libraries in python
implement concepts from the [*Grammar of graphics*](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447). 

  * **General purpose visualization:** 
 	 * *static visualization* : 
      * [matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org/) is the standard 2D and 3D plotting library for python. See this [tutorial](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb) and some [explanations](https://dev.to/skotaro/artist-in-matplotlib---something-i-wanted-to-know-before-spending-tremendous-hours-on-googling-how-tos--31oo) on how plots work, the euroscipy 2019 [tutorial](https://github.com/timhoffm/euroscipy2019-using-matplotlib)
      * [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a great to matplotlib for statistical data vizualisation with python (default plots look good with seaborn) : [tutorial](http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [examples](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), here is a nice [collection of ressources](https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/libraries/seaborn/). (note that seaborn is well integrated in holoviews)
      * [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) is a plotting system for Python based on R's ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics. see also this [video](www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrwqLhAaMw)
      * [altair](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair) is a new declarative statistical visualization library : [documentation](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair), [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair/blob/master/altair/notebooks/01-Index.ipynb)

    * *interactive visualization (within Jupyter notebooks)*
      * [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/)  lets you store your data in an annotated format that is instantly visualizable, with immediate access to both the numeric data and its visualization : [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jhUivliNSo), [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNsR2H7Lrg0), [example notebooks](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib), list [holoviews elements](http://holoviews.org/Tutorials/Elements.html), holoview for visualizing [distribution data](http://holoviews.org/Tutorials/Pandas_Seaborn.html).
      * [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) is an interactive data visualization library that implements the grammar of graphics : [example gallery](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html#gallery), [notebook gallery](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb), [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9CgHHz_iYk) [](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1224/bokeh-an-extensible-implementation-of-the-gramma)
      * [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot) is a Grammar of Graphics-based interactive plotting framework for the Jupyter notebook. 
      * plotly is another interactive visualization library, probably more oriented to making charts and dashboard for companies: [documentation](https://plot.ly/python/offline/), [examples](https://plot.ly/python/)

  * **Visualizing geographical data** :
 	 * *static visualization* : 
      * ( [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/) is an extension to matplotlib that allows to plot geographical data:  [documentation](https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ) => not maintained anymore
      * [Cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) provides cartographic tools for python (developped by the MetOffice) : [documentation](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html)

   * *interactive vizualization (within Jupyter notebooks)* :
      * [GeoViews](http://geo.holoviews.org/)  (*recommended*) is built on HoloViews. It allows to explore and visualize geographical  data interactively. Works nicely with xarray : [demo](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/introducing-geoviews),  [examples](http://geo.holoviews.org/index.html), see also how to work with gridded data with geoviews [part 1](http://geo.holoviews.org/Gridded_Datasets_I.html) and [part 2](http://geo.holoviews.org/Gridded_Datasets_II.html)

  * **How to choose a colormap**: 
   * see this resourtce on [perceptually uniform colormaps](http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/), 
   * see this discussion for a [better default colormap for matplotlib](http://bids.github.io/colormap/)
   * check out these useful colormaps : [colorcet](https://github.com/bokeh/colorcet), [cmoceans](https://plot.ly/python/cmocean-colorscales/)

### Optimizing python codes
Python is great for fast prototyping of production code. It also has the reputation of being rather slow as compared to other languages (as for instance Fortran, C or C++). There are therefore a lot of options for accelerating python code, with classical solutions generally involving  interfacing python code with faster languages. This is the general idea behind [f2py](http://www.f2py.com/), [Weave](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/weave.html), [Cython](http://cython.org/).  Although some of theses solutions can be very helpful for interfacing pre-existing legacy code, we here promote the use of [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/). Numba indeed gives you the power to speed up your applications with a few annotations  without having to switch languages or Python interpreters.
